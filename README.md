## Misc stuff used for installations

- `robo3t.desktop` is the file that registers Robo3T, for example, with the Ubuntu system. It contains the preferred pathname for self-installed programs (`/usr/local/bin/`)

- `refind` folder contains the basic setup and my theme, including a TrueOS icon and better ones (than original) for Windows and Ubuntu. Change settings in `refind.conf` and `themes/rEFInd-minimal/theme.conf`. [Here's the website](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/). On Ubuntu, all this should be installed at `/boot/efi/EFI/(refind dir goes here)`.
